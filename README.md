# Beginner-Programing for Simple Program
1. replace string
   - it usually use for replace one spesific string to new string
2. string check
   - it usually use to check string contain such as:
        - begin or end with one or bunch of spesific character
        - string contain only number
        - string contain only alphabet
        - string contain space
        - string contain words with title format
        - string contain only upper or lower cased character
3. formating string
   - it usually use to give format string to spesific format
        - use to adjust string alignment
        - use to display special character that can be break the program use backslash
        - use to display some comand that usually doesn't show in output
4. assign variable
   - it usually use to place data iterable or string so make it easier to call it when needed. it also possible to give variable to each element in iterable data type using 2 method available using index or same element
5. input and output
   -input usually use to make user able to input data without need to change the code program
   -output usually use to display data that already process to user using function print()
6. convert data type
   - convert data type use when we need other type data to exploit its special characteristic like for set no duplicated value so can be used when we dont want duplicated value. convert data type also usefull for input data using input function cause input unction will give input data string variable make it can't be process as number using operator
7. operator, operand and expression
   - operator are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed. these operator like addition,multiplication,modulo,floor division, substract, and divison. need to be note that number not only one who can be operated with operator string, list and tuple also can be operated with right condition
   - operand is value or variable we want to operated
   - expression is value after operand operated with operator 
8. Boolean operator
   -boolean operator consist of true and false usually like operator such as:
      -and = only return value as true if both operand equal to True
      -or = only return value as true if one of the operand is true
9. if, elif and else
   -if usually use for excecute command if condition fullfil
   -elseif or short for elseif usually use for excecute command if condition in if not fulfill but fulfil in elif
   -else usually use if no spesific condition so other if not fulfill will use else comand
